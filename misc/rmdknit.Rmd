```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      include = TRUE)


```

What will the code chunk below show? What do I need to do to hide its output when knitting?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
```

The code chunk below is designed to produce a table. What will it show when you knit?

```{r echo = TRUE}
cars %>% 
  summarize(avg_speed = mean(speed)) %>% 
  gt()
```

The code chunk below this is designed to produce a histogram. What will it show when you knit?

```{r include = FALSE}
cars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(speed)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
