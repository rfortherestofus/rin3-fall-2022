# Example Data Viz with `{ggtext}`

## Dumbbell charts and {ggtext}

.pull-left[
Let's walk through building this beautiful chart from [Stephanie Evergeen](https://stephanieevergreen.com/easy-dot-plots-in-excel/) in {ggplot2}.

This is a dumbell chart that uses colour in the title in place of a legend. We can do this using {ggtext}

## Doing even more with `{ggtext}`

.pull-left[

Our colleague Cara Thompson ran an incredible workshop at NHS-R in November 2022 about levelling up your charts [with {ggtext}].

<br>

You can watch the video and view Cara's slides [on her website](https://www.cararthompson.com/talks/nhsr2022-level-up).

## Group work

--

Your task is decipher how I made [this graph](https://share.rfor.us/v1ub7qWe)

![](https://p218.p3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/v1ub7qWe/1633a0d2-bde3-405a-8a91-cebf912a1809.jpg?source=viewer&v=362ab84fc710116e10f7aa692d1ed927)

--

- Why is the y aesthetic property set to 1?

--

- What does shape = 124 do?

--

- What does geom_hline() do in this viz?

--

- Why do I have to specifically add x axis text using the line `theme(axis.text.x = element_text(color = "grey80")`)?
