We don't care what YOU HAVE been able to do. What's next? Put everyone at the same level (as many will be behind)

just do this in Zoom chat.

# What else can RMarkdown do?

---

## RMarkdown can do a lot...

We've seen that you can make the following:

--

.pull-left[

- HTML reports

- PDF reports

- Word reports

... but there's a lot more.
]

--

.pull-right[

- Beautiful books with `bookdown`

- Beautiful reports with `pagedown`

- Beautiful slides with `xaringan`

- Programmatically generated reports

- Dashboards (... and even shiny apps!)

- Websites all in RMarkdown!

## Beautiful books with `bookdown`

.pull-left[
The `bookdown` package was used for writing R for Data Science and many other extremely useful R books.

## Beautiful reports with `pagedown`

.pull-left[
The `pagedown` package is designed to simplify designing documents you need to print.

Instead of learning `LaTeX` you can use HTML and CSS!

## `pagedreport`

.pull-left[
R for the Rest of Us has created a package called [`pagedreport`](https://pagedreport.rfortherestofus.com/) that adds several templates to `pagedown`.

## Websites created all in RMarkdown

---

## `distill` for websites (and blogs)

Using `distill` is the easiest way to create a fully functioning data blog with RMarkdown.

--

We'll put together a thorough discussion thread about this.


---

## Parameterized reports

Use [parametrized RMarkdown reporting](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html) to make a separate report for each region

```{yaml}
---
params:
  state: "Alaska"
title: "`r params$state` Report"
---
  
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
qualitative_data %>% 
  filter(state == params$state)
```

### Final assignment

We'd love to understand how R in 3 Months is going to help you with your work/datasets.

--

We'd like you to record a 5 minute video showing something you can now do with your real data/project.

> [Loom.com](https://www.loom.com/pricing) has a free tier that will allow you to record and share 5 minute videos.

There's a form to fill on [Week 13's assignment submission page](https://rfortherestofus.com/courses/r-in-3-months-fall-2022/lessons/r-in-3-months-sfall-2022-final-project-assignment/).

2. [Post-survey that shows your skill now](https://rfor.us/rin3-fall22-feedback) (we'll compare this to what you told us in the pre-survey) and allows you to provide anonymous feedback.
